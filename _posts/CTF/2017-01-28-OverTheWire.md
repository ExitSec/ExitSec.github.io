[Over The Wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) has been one of the go to places for starter capture the flag challenges. Bandit in particular is suited for learning Linux commands, but also for anyone trying to break into capture the flag scenarios. For anyone that would like to enter capture the flag events check out [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/), as well as [captf](https://captf.com/practice-ctf/).

The write up that I did in the past for Over The Wire:Bandit is downloadable from this post and have updated the structure of the document so it flows better:
