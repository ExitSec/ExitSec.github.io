Machine Learning is a growing venture which impacts many facets of life. Machine Learning is seen to be integrated into most products, e.g., G-Suite, Amazon Alexa, Predictive Text and Medicine. The field of Machine Learning is a new bridge between the fields of Statistics and Computer Science, which forms Data Science.

A significant portion of my time is spent researching, studying and practising the tools, techniques and methodologies of machine learning and offensive capabilities. Therefore, in the coming future posts, part of this blog will be dedicated to utilising machine learning.
**This post will be used to list all the topics and their associated links around the website (It's going to be updated throughout the series)**
