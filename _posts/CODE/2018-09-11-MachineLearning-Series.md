Machine Learning is a growing venture which impacts many facets of life. Machine Learning is seen to be integrated into most products, e.g., G-Suite, Amazon Alexa, Predictive Text and Medicine. The field of Machine Learning is a new bridge between the fields of Statistics and Computer Science, which forms Data Science. 

A significant portion of my time is spent researching, studying and practising the tools, techniques and methodologies. Therefore, in the coming year, part of this blog will be dedicated to the understanding of regressive and classification algorithms, but a breakdown of machine learning with the aim to help anyone breaking into the field of Machine Learning. Each technical area will be using a split of generic data sets as to demonstrate the process, with the addition of the applications towards the field of Intrusion Detection. The series will be favouring Python instead of R, but guided explanation will be presented to help anyone wanting to use a different language (As long as the libraries are there!).

**This post will be used to list all the topics and their associated links around the website (It's going to be updated throughout the series)**
